# Advent of Code 2023 - with Rust
These are my attempts on [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com) solutions using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Every folder contains 

- the program to solve both parts of the puzzle (via functions called part_1 and part_2).
- the **input.txt** file for the puzzles input data.

The program takes the input.txt and returns the solutions for part 1 and part 2.
