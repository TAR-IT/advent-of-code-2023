# Advent of Code 2023 - with Rust
These are my attempts on [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com) solutions using the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org).

Every folder contains 

- the program to solve both parts of the puzzle of each day.
- a input.txt file for the puzzle input.

The program takes the input.txt and returns the solutions for part 1 and part 2.
